A. A brief description of notable obstacles overcame

The most notable obstacle was trying to think of all the corner cases which "hasProperSyntax" would fail. Thinking of multiple character and digit combinations that do not count as valid party results but slipped through "hasProperSyntax".

B. Pseudocode

Int tallySeats(string pollData, char party, int& seatTally)

Check if 'party' input is a valid character
	if not
		return 2
Repeatedly while there are still characters left in the pollData:
	Check if pollData is a valid poll data string
		if pollData isn't valid
			return 1
	Determine if the current state forecast has data relating to given party 
		if state forecast has data
			determine the amount of seats predicted to win and add to seats
			continue on to the next state forecast
		if state forecast has no relevant data
			continue on to the next state forecast
	If there are no more state forecasts
		add seats to seatTally
		return 0



C. List of Test Data 

    testCase[0] = {"ca,ny,ma",'x',seatTally} // state forecast with no poll results

    testCase[1] = {"ca,ny,ma",'1',seatTally} // char party is not a letter

    testCase[2] = {"ca,,ny,ma",'x',seatTally} //two or more consecutive commas

    testCase[3] = {"ca,ny,ma,",'x',seatTally} //comma at the end

    testCase[4] = {",ca,ny,ma",'x',seatTally} //comma at beginning

    testCase[5] = {"",'x',seatTally} //empty string

    testCase[6] = {"banana",'x',seatTally} //random string

    testCase[7] = {"california",'x',seatTally};//string that start with state codes

    testCase[8] = {"ca9li",'x',seatTally = 0};//random party letters with no poll results

    testCase[9] = {"ca111r",'r',seatTally = 0} //if pollData has more than 2 consecutive digits

    testCase[10] = {"cal",'r',seatTally = 0} //checks if a single character after statecode with fail

    testCase[11] = {"ca10r17d,ny77r,nv22d,co,wa5r13d17i",'D',seatTally = 0} //search for 'D' poll Results

    testCase[12] = {"ca10r17d,ny77r,nv22d,co,wa5r13d17i",'R',seatTally = 0} //search for 'R' poll Results

    testCase[13] = {"ca10r17d,ny77r,nv22d,co,,wa5r13d17i",'R',seatTally = 0} //faulty pollData in the middle of string

    testCase[14] = {"ct5d,ny9r17d1i",'x',seatTally = 0};//checks if seatTally is set to zero

    testCase[15] = {"ca,ny,ma",'x',seatTally = 0} //chekcs if seatTally is set to zero

    testCase[16] = {"ct5d,ny9r17+1i",'x',seatTally = 0}; //checks if "17+" will give correct return value

    testCase[17] = {"ct5d,ny9r17d1i",'d',seatTally = 0} /checks if proper number is given back for given input

    testCase[18] = {"ct5d,ny9r17d1i",'+',seatTally = 0} //checks for return value of 2 if non-character is given

    testCase[19] = {"ct5d,ny9r17+1i",'d',seatTally = 100} //checks if value of seatTally is changed if pollData is determined faulty in the program

    testCase[20] = {"ca+",'d',seatTally = 0} //checks if non-character values will fail function "hasProperSyntax"
